# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

def fizzbuzz(low, high)
  result = []
  (low..high).to_a.each do |num|
    if num % 15 == 0
      result << 'FizzBuzz'
    elsif num % 3 == 0
      result << 'Fizz'
    elsif num % 5 == 0
      result << 'Buzz'
    else
      result << num
    end
  end
  result.join(', ')
end

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
