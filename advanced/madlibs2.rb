# Make a madlibs program that reads in some text from a text file that you have created, and then plugs in a selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text and prints it. You can build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs directly into your program, but the text data should come from a file or other external source. Your program should read this text, and for each line, it should place random words of the appropriate types into the text, and print the result.

ADJECTIVES = %w(quick lazy sleepy ugly).freeze
NOUNS      = %w(fox dog head leg cat tail).freeze
VERBS      = %w(spins bites licks hurdles).freeze
ADVERBS    = %w(easily lazily noisly excitedly).freeze

File.open('madlibs.txt') do |file|
  file.each do |line|
    puts format(line, noun: NOUNS.sample, verb: VERBS.sample, adjective: ADJECTIVES.sample, adverb: ADVERBS.sample)
  end
end
